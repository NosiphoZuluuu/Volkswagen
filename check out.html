                The GLA’s infotainment system is great. The built-in sat-nav can feature augmented reality if you tick the right box, which means it will overlay directional arrows onto a live picture of the view ahead displayed on the 10.25-inch touchscreen. It’s clever tech, but you have to take your eyes off the road to benefit from it, so it has its strengths and its flaws.

Of course, if you’d prefer you can use one of the standard Android Auto and Apple CarPlay functions. You’ll have to plug in your phone, but there is also wireless charging if you don’t use either of these functions.

Otherwise, the graphics on the Mercedes setup are super-sharp and the touchscreen responds quickly; you can use the touch-sensitive pad on the transmission tunnel, but it’s a bit tricky at times. The menu layout removes a lot of the complexity though, because it’s so simple to navigate.

            <p class="enginep">Engines, 0-60 acceleration and top speed
                The GLA’s engine range is pretty straightforward with three petrol units, two diesels and a single petrol plug-in hybrid to choose from. 
                Both the entry-level GLA 180 (no longer on the GLA price list) and more expensive 200 versions use a 1.3-litre petrol engine, with 134bhp and 161bhp, respectively. The base car is able to deliver a 0-62mph dash of 9.6s and a maximum speed of 124mph, which is probably more than enough performance for most tastes. 
                However, moving up the range does add extra spice, with the GLA 200 trimming almost a full second off the 180’s sprint time, before motoring on to a 130mph top speed. The GLA 250 2.0-litre petrol variant no longer features on the GLA price list, although was the quickest car in the range below the AMG variants. With a potent 221bhp, it’s capable of 0-62mph in 6.9s and tops-out at 149mph.
                Diesel power comes in the form of the 2.0-litre GLA 200 d and 220 d models, which offer good pace as well as improvements in CO2 emissions and fuel economy. The 148bhp 200 d is available with front-wheel-drive, completing 0-62mph in under nine seconds and offering a top speed approaching 130mph. The 187bhp GLA 220 d 4Matic is four-wheel-drive only, but is noticeably quicker, posting a sprint time of 7.3s.
